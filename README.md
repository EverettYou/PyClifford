# About

This is a `python` based Clifford circuit simulation package that not only offers fast simulation but also supports analytical-level manipulation of Pauli operators and stabilizer states. And we are working on quantum circuit (strong/weak) simulations that include a few T-gates. To get started, in the [examples](https://github.com/hongyehu/PyClifford/tree/main/examples) folder (or older version [PyClifford Jupyter Book](https://hongyehu.github.io/PyCliffordPages/intro.html)), we have made several Jupyter notebooks to illustrate the basics of PyClifford. It is very intuitive to use and get started!

<!-- Installation of PyClifford also installs `TorchClifford`, a parallel package that contains the same functionality but in a vectorized and GPU-friendly format. To use TorchClifford, simply `import torchclifford` rather than `import pyclifford`. -->


Also, there are several application show cases below that are helpful.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation üõ†Ô∏è

You can install **PyClifford** locally by following these simple steps:

### 1. Set up your Python environment

It‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

<details>
<summary><strong>Using conda (recommended)</strong></summary>

```bash
conda create --name pyclifford python=3.11
conda activate pyclifford
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Using venv (if not using conda)</strong></summary>
 
```bash
python3 -m venv pyclifford-env
source pyclifford-env/bin/activate
```
</details>

###  2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have the following packages installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib numba qutip
```
You may also need to install a compatible version of setuptools:
```bash
pip install setuptools==68.2.2
```

### 3. Clone and install PyClifford

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hongyehu/PyClifford.git
cd PyClifford
pip install .
```

### 4. Test the installation

Open a Python shell and try:
```bash
import pyclifford as pc
print(pc.pauli("X"))
```
You should see output corresponding to the Pauli X operator! Congratulations! üéâ

## :fire: New Feature :fire:

**We're excited to introduce our latest feature!:** :sparkles: 
- A new `examples` folder containing step-by-step examples.
- Generalized stabilizer states that support non-Clifford gates.


## üí¨ Quotes from our first few users üí¨:
 - Prof. Zhen Bi (Pappalardo Fellow 17'@MIT, Assistant Professor@PennState): 
  > "*PyClifford is an exceptional tool that offers researchers in quantum condensed matter a wide range of capabilities, including an intuitive programming language for simulating and analyzing Clifford circuits, quantum measurement, and evaluation of entanglement quantities, all of which are crucial in advancing our understanding of the quantum world. Its continuous updates and enhancements by a well-coordinated team of experts make it a reliable and powerful resource that can keep pace with the latest research developments and drive new discoveries in the field.*"

## üß± Structure of `PyClifford` üß±:
The structure of `PyClifford` is illustrated below. Pauli strings, stabilizer states, and Clifford maps are represented by binary or integer strings. All the low-level calculation is in the `utils.py` with JIT compliation. Then `paulialg.py` handles all the Pauli algebra and manipulation of Pauli string lists. On top of that, we have built `stabilizer.py` to handle stabilizer states and Clifford maps. Finally, `circuit.py` gives user an easy access to all the functions.

In addition, we are interested in developing `PyCliffordExt` as an extension to `PyClifford`, where we would like to include few-T gate into the package. If you are interested in its physics or contributing to the code, please feel free to [contact us](https://scholar.harvard.edu/hongyehu/home)!

## Dependence of `PyClifford`:
- Numba
- Numpy
- QuTip
- Matplotlib
### Dependence of `PyCliffordExt`:
- Qiskit 0.39.4
- Pyscf 2.0.1

## üîÆ What will be in the next release (June-July 2025) üîÆ: 
- Generalized stabilizer states
- Noisy circuit simulation of classical shadows
- One-line calculation of Pauli weight used for classical post-processing. (Tensor network-based algorithm)


<!--**For MacOS user:** you can create a virtual environment containing necessary dependences with `conda env create -f env/miniClifford.yml`-->

## Changes
We are planning to move **TorchClifford** to a separate package and keep **PyClifford** lightweight, as users' suggestions. For users of **TorchClifford**, please keep an eye for the update.
